## Given a list of words (it could be any length) and a string of text, find the shortest substring that contains all the words in the list.

For example: given a list [cat, dog, chased] and the string.
"My cat was missing today. I hope she comes back. She was chased by the dog next door. I love my cat"
should return "chased by the dog next door. I love my cat"

## Test Cases
* "My cat was missing today. I hope she comes back. She was chased by the dog next door. I love my cat";
  * ["cat", "dog", "chased"];

* "The world is here. this is a life full of ups and downs. life is world";
  * ["life", "ups", "is", "world"];

* "My cat was missing today. I hope she comes back. She was chased by the dog next door. I love my cat";
  * ['cat', 'dog', 'chased', 'back'];

* "this is a test. this is a programming test. a programming test this is";
  * ["this", "test", "a", "programming"];
